This repository contains a simple Kotlin program demonstrating the use of Lists and MutableLists.  It highlights the key differences between immutable (List) and mutable (MutableList) collections and shows common operations such as mapping and adding/removing elements. This example is helpful for understanding Kotlin's collection types and how to choose the appropriate one based on your needs.
